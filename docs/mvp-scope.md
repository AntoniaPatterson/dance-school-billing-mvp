# MVP Scope

This project is an admin-only MVP designed to automate billing workflows for dance school owners/administrators.

## Background

This project is based on real challenges experienced whilst using other management systems whilst running a dance school. 
Existing class management platforms require significant manual effort to handle common billing tasks, 
particularly when updating prices, the capacity to add one-off fees and chasing/sending overdue payments.

This MVP focuses only on automating these high-friction billing workflows for dance school owners/administrators.

## Problems Solved

1. Bulk class price updates  
   - Make amendments to a class fee
   - Apply class fee changes across all student invoices in a register 

2. One-off custom fees  
   - Add single fees (e.g. £15 late payment fee)
   - Fees appear as separate invoice line items
   - Set an automatic date for the fee to be added every month 

3. Bulk overdue invoice reminders  
   - Send reminders to all overdue invoices in one action
   - Record reminder status per invoice

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly out of scope for this MVP:
- Parent portal
- Payment processing
- Class booking
- Attendance tracking
- Discounts
- Waiting List
- Mobile application
